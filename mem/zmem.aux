\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {The main feature of this game is that you won't be able to directly control your units, in case of that, you will give them orders and the units should behave according to them but with a high free will grade.}}{3}{section*.3}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {The horde will be separated into groups of units that you will be able to select. Using the mouse and the graphic interface provided, you will give these orders to your troops, an example can be ``approach to that position'' or ``became aggressive''.}}{3}{section*.4}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {subsection}{\numberline {1.2}Motivation}{3}{subsection.1.2}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {We have chosen this kind of game because we think that the AI integration possibilities are huge. AI principles can be integrated in many of the game components, for example, in the game engine, AI techniques can be used in order to define and implement the units free will, also it can be combined with an agent-based approach. AI could also be applied to make opponents for the game, we should define their strategies, decision, etc...}}{3}{section*.5}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {The most immediate problem to solve is the behaviour of the units. With most of the techniques we should solve problems like units movement, path finding, collision avoidance or unit tracking.}}{4}{section*.12}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {Other aspect of the game that can be involved in AI developing can be the opponent strategy.

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {The zombies model is based in two parameters, firs of all we have the destination point which is the zombies goal to reach, on the other hand we have the hunger of the zombies group. If the zombies are hungry they would tend to wander around while reaching the point, if the hunger level gets low the zombies will appear to come closer to the point obeying the player's order directly.}}{4}{section*.15}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {When programming the zombies movement we should take those parameters in consideration and apply an straight movement and a movement pattern for randomness when wandering. These movement pattern should be applied by using AI techniques, with different techniques we could achieve richer patterns going from a random pattern to behaviours like birds flocks, particle swarm or something different.}}{4}{section*.16}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {A rules based system, a neural network or CBR can be implemented to achieve this.}}{4}{section*.17}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {This problem is mostly a feature of the game engine. With the integration of a physics module which will simulate the collisions of solid models there should be physical interaction between the elements of the game. For example, a unit will not be able to pass through a tree or a wall or also through another unit; also, it will have to adapt its movement to the terrain topology.}}{5}{section*.18}}
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {For that reason, when a element is commanded to move through the map the game engine should find for him a valid path in order to keep the movement realistic and avoiding that element (normally and avatar) to get stuck in somewhere.}}{5}{section*.19}}

\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {paragraph}{\indent \textnormal  {This AI system should variate in complexity, different models and behaviours can be programmed in order to give the game a different approach. For example, a simple rule based system can be implemented in order to do that conferring the an ``arcade'' approach. However, we can also integrate an combination of different AI techniques even including learning, to make a robust opponent for a different kind of game with also a really good academic interest.}}{5}{section*.22}}
